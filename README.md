# Ruby
A ruby script, which scans my gmail for certain types of email, and does something "useful" with them


# Goal


-Different keywords to search for emails with different subjects

-User input determines which emails will be printed

-Printed email Titles will have a marking at the end, showing if the email has been already read or not



# What have I done so far


-I found a ruby gem, which makes my code a lot shorter and easier

-I deleted 4000 unread emails (that took half an hour)

-Tried to restore some of the trashed emails, but haven't succeeded yet
